Data Analytics play a very crucial role in the world today. It has benefits which lead to company or organizational growth. Data is generated in exabytes by an organization which can be used for manipulation and behavioral patterns can be studied. Analysis can be performed on any data to study the different patterns; hence we have decided to consider the data of the google play store. Google Play store is a store for applications for the Android devices. The data about the various applications can be provided by this store. The applications are from various domains which can downloaded and used. Every application has a title, version, ratings, reviews, category, price, etc. This data about the applications can be manipulated for growing the business in the world of applications. Here we are, developing a project which would help us know which application is more useful, which application domain would make more money, which genre of applications is more liked by the users, which application would gain fame, etc.
